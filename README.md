<h2>Summary</h2>

This project evaluates gradient boosting machine learning models to make a recommendation on the best model to make predictions on the market value of used cars. It also compares the gradient boosting models to non-gradient boosting models.

<h2>Table of Contents</h2>

1. Machine Learning Models (notebooks > ML.ipynb)
      
        a) Project introduction
        b) Library and data importation
        c) Data preprocessing - finding and removing duplicate values, filling in missing values, etc.
        d) Brief EDA - evaluating potential trends in the numeric values
        e) Beginning of Machine Learning: Encode, split, and scale the data
        f) Calculate the RMSE
        g) Dummy value calculations
        h) Machine learning models: Decision Tree, Random Forest, Linear, LightGBM, and CatBoost
        i) Final testing
        j) Project conclusion
