# Gradient Boosting Models

<h2>Summary</h2>

This project evaluates gradient boosting machine learning models to make a recommendation on the best model to make predictions on the market value of used cars. It also compares the gradient boosting models to non-gradient boosting models.

<h2>Table of Contents</h2>

1. Machine Learning Models (notebooks > ML.ipynb)
      
        a) Project introduction
        b) Library and data importation
        c) Data preprocessing - finding and removing duplicate values, filling in missing values, etc.
        d) Brief EDA - evaluating potential trends in the numeric values
        e) Beginning of Machine Learning: Encode, split, and scale the data
        f) Calculate the RMSE
        g) Dummy value calculations
        h) Machine learning models: Decision Tree, Random Forest, Linear, LightGBM, and CatBoost
        i) Final testing
        j) Project conclusion


<h2>Local Access</h2>

This project will require Python 3.11.5 or later.

All packages required can be installed from the requirements.txt file by executing the command 'pip install -r requirements.txt'

To run the Jupyter notebook, it can be downloaded from the repository (the main branch) and run in the IDE of your choice that can accommodate.

Please note that the data that was originally provided by the client and is proprietary. It is not available in this repository for that reason.


<h2>Plans for Updates</h2>

Fix the code for XGBoost using previously successful projects as examples to test an additional model and ensure optimization for this project.
